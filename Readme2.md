Update of IbusBM (Arduino IDE 2.2.1) (STM32 2.6.0 from STMicroelectronics) (3.6.0 Earle F. Philhower)

add RP2040 timer (ARDUINO_ARCH_RP2040) sensors are not working (i don't know for the momment why) hardware half duplex ???

add STM32 timer (ARDUINO_ARCH_STM32) sensors are working 
leave the '_VARIANT_ARDUINO_STM32_' definition ( I think older libraries )
